# Text Utility Web App

This was my first project with Djangoâ€”a simple web application that provides basic text processing utilities.

## Features
- **Remove Punctuation**: Cleans your text by removing all punctuation marks.
- **Convert to Uppercase**: Transforms all text to uppercase.
- **Remove New Lines**: Eliminates all unnecessary line breaks.
- **Remove Extra Spaces**: Trims excessive spaces between words.
- **Character Counter**: Counts the number of characters in the text.
